## github upstream merge (sync a forked repository)
* make sure you are in the working directory
* open the shell
* the first time you do this you will need to setup the upstream branch (note: change USEPA to the user and LakeTrophicModelling to the repo)
  - get remote -v
  - git remote add upstream https://github.com/USEPA/LakeTrophicModelling
* once you are setup use the following commands to sync the original to upstream then the upstream to the fork master.
  - git checkout master (just in case)
  - git pull (just in case)
  - git remote -v
 
 
  - git fetch upstream 
  - git merge upstream/master
  - git push origin master
